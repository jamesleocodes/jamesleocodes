Hi, I'm James Leo



I'm a Machine Learning Researcher/Cheminformatics Scientist at University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

- ðŸ‘‹ Currently, I am working on two projects. One is to build algorithms to predict physico-chemical properties(i.e LogP/LogD, PSA etc..) and retention time for drug development projects. The other one is to classify between Healthy control and Parkinson disease by using eyemovement data.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding(code for fun) with python,R, C/C++, SQL and matlab.
