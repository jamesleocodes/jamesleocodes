Hi, I'm James Leo



I'm a Machine Learning Researcher/Cheminformatics Scientist at Centre for Eye and Vision Research (CEVR, Hong Kong Science Park.

- üëã These are the projects I have completed and currently working on at CEVR. 
  
June 2021 -Dec 2021
ÔÇß	Project-1 -Using Machine Learning To Predict Partition Coefficient (Log P) and Distribution Coefficient (Log D) with Molecular Descriptors and Liquid Chromatography Retention Time

-	Curated datasets from a variety of public databases, like PubChem and CheMBL 
-	Developed a machine learning models and deep learning models to rank molecules for the drug candidate. 
-	Patented the innovation at U.S. Patent and Trademark OfÔ¨Åce (USPTO) and CNIP. 
-	Published in American Chemical Society (ACS) recently. More details can be found in here https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01373
-	GitHub Repository: https://github.com/jamesleocodes/p_chem_CEVR

On-going
ÔÇß	Project-1.1 ‚Äì Developing iMoleQ which is a cloud-based web application designed to predict molecular properties. 
-	The frontend development of iMoleQ has been completed, and you can access it at www.imoleq.com.
-	Currently, we are in the process of integrating the backend with the API and server-side components.
-	GitHub Repository: https://github.com/jamesleocodes/iMoleQ?tab=readme-ov-file

Jan 2022 -Dec 2022
ÔÇß	Project-2 - AI-Enabled Diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease from Eye Movement Data

-	Fitted with analytical wavefunction to simplify the eye movement data.
-	Developed and implemented signal processing algorithms to extract meaningful features from raw eye movement data (i.e. in waveforms).
-	Built and fine-tuned machine learning models to differentiate Parkinson‚Äôs disease patients from healthy controls using eye movement data.
-	The innovation from this research is preparing for patent to submit to the U.S. Patent and Trademark OfÔ¨Åce (USPTO).
-	GitHub Repository: https://github.com/jamesleocodes/eye_movement

Jan 2023 -Aug 2023
ÔÇß	Project-3- Diagnosing Diabetic Retinopathy: A Machine Learning Approach to CIL LC-MS Analysis of Tear Sample Metabolites 

-	Implemented a project on biomarker discovery for diabetic retinopathy disease using metabolomic data processing and machine learning. 
-	Managed data cleanup, feature engineering, and utilized tree-based algorithms (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Random Forest) for accurate disease classification, with potential for real-world clinical diagnostic application. The paper related to the research will be published in American Chemical Society (ACS) soon.

Sep 2023 -Present
ÔÇß	Project-4
Machine Learning-Assisted Identification of Potential Metabolite Biomarkers for Glaucoma Diagnosis through Serum Metabolomic Analysis

-	Developed machine learning models to identify biomarkers for glaucoma from metabolomic data, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.  
-	Data acquired from analyzing serum samples of participants using high-resolution mass spectrometry.  
-	 Utilized Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost algorithms, achieving up to 0.87 accuracy.  
-	 Identified significant metabolite linked to glaucoma through SHAP analysis.
-	The paper related to the research will be published in American Chemical Society (ACS) soon.
