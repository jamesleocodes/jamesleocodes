Hi, I'm James Leo



I'm a Machine Learning Researcher/Cheminformatics Scientist at University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

- ðŸ‘‹ Currently, I am working on building algorithms to predict physico-chemical properties(i.e LogP/LogD, PSA etc..) for drug development projects. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding(code for fun) with python, R, C/C++, SQL and matlab.
